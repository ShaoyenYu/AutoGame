A game automation framework based on python + android simulator on windows.

This framework is based on:

## Road Map

- Support [adb](https://pypi.org/project/pure-python-adb/) as an alternative execution way
- Add a gui based on [flet](https://flet.dev/).
- Add mobile interaction interface based on [telegram-bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots).
